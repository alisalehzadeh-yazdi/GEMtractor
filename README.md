Using the GEMtractor you can trim (currency-)metabolites, reactions, genes, or enzyme complexes off you GEMs, to for example focus on subnetworks as reported by prior flux balance analyses.
From the trimmed model you may then extract the Reaction-centric or Enzyme-centric network, wich can be exported in different graph formats for subsequent analyses.


The GEMtractor comes with support for Docker -- installing an own instance is pretty easy, see <a href="https://gemtractor.bio.informatik.uni-rostock.de/learn/#own-gemtractor">Run your own GEMtractor</a>.
It also features an <a href="https://gemtractor.bio.informatik.uni-rostock.de/learn#api">API</a>, so you may use the GEMtractor from your software tools.
There is plenty of more information at the <a href="https://gemtractor.bio.informatik.uni-rostock.de/learn">FAQ</a> and the <a href="https://doc.bio.informatik.uni-rostock.de/GEMtractor/">Python documentation</a>.
