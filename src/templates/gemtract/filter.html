  <h2>Reduce Model Size</h2>

  <p>
    You can now discard a subset of the model's entities (species, reactions, enzymes, or enzyme complexes) to reduce the model size.
    A concentrated model may improve subsequent computations dramatically.

        <p>A red row indicates, that the corresponding species does not participate in any reaction anymore, so you may want to exclude it as well? If uncheck a species, it will not be removed from the entire model, but it will be removed from all reactions (it may still be used in other entities, such as functions or triggers). However, there may be ghost species afterwards, not participating in any reaction.

        <p>A red row indicates, that your filter would keep the reaction in the model, but some (or all) of it's species and/or all associated genes were removed. So the reaction may be wrong afterwards, and you may want to exclude the reaction as well? If you export the <em>reaction network</em> and you removed all it's species, the reaction will be removed as well. If you export the <em>enzyme network,</em> the reaction will be removed if all it's species are removed or all it's genes are removed.
