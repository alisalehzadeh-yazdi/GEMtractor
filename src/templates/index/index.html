<p>
  This is the <strong>GEMtractor.</strong> It supports you in analyzing genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs)!
</p>
<p>
  Choose an SBML model and it will help you to <strong>filter currency metabolites,</strong> to <strong>simulate knock out experiments,</strong> or to <strong>reduce the model size</strong> to e.g. focus on your flux balance results. And much more...
</p>
<p>
  You may then extract the protein-interaction-network from the concentrated model, and finally export you network in several formats for subsequent analyses.
</p>
<p>
  There is an API, so you may use the GEMtractor from your programs. The GEMtractor is free software and also available as a Docker image. Thus, running your own GEMtractor is as easy as calling a single command line &mdash; including all the benefits, such as privacy and speed! Read more about the setup at ... TODO

  If you dare to harvest your models, click <a href="{% url 'gemtract:index' %}">Start</a> from the top panel.
